## Backup

All of a sudden, he realized what he had let go of.

Years ago when I was not familiar with git, I backup my blog simply through copying and pasting, even including the `node_modules` folder. However, now I would like to upload this mess to GitHub so that everyone can *enjoy* it.

In Jan. 2019, I backed-up my first blog (it was created much earlier). It somehow magically survived till now so you can still find it at [aaadsgfh.github.io](https://aaadsgfh.github.io/). Years later reading the content I feelâ€”well, quite embarrassed. But I decided to keep it as a memory, or let's be more specific, a burial.

Then somehow I started to learn web (well, there's **much** to say about that *somehow* :wink:, ask me if you are interested in) and I created [my second blog](2019-2). It is based on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and theme [NexT](https://theme-next.js.org/). You can still preview it by running `npm i` (to install packages) and `hexo s` (to start Hexo server, you need to install Hexo first).

For the other parts, I won't go into details. The only two important folders have been mentioned above. You can navigate through this repository if you like.

Archived... Maybe?

Well, I don't think anyone would be interested in this repo, but I'll still use MIT License anyway.
